    1. Identification of the core problem: Has the child recognized the main conflict or issue?  
    2. Understanding of roles and behaviors: Does the child show awareness of who is involved and what actions were taken?  
    3. Recognition of emotions and reactions: Has the child identified how people are feeling or responding to the situation?  
    4. Awareness of relational context: Does the child understand the relationships or dynamics between people involved (e.g., closeness, power, responsibility)?  
    5. Anticipation of outcomes or potential conflict: Does the child consider what might happen next or recognize possible consequences?

    **Scoring Guide:**  

    - **Very High (80–100%)**  
    - The child clearly addresses at least four or three of the five key aspects  
    - Demonstrates a deep understanding of the situation, including social relationships, emotional context, and likely outcomes

    - **High (60–79%)**  
    - At least three or two key aspects are addressed clearly  
    - The child shows good understanding overall but lacks detail or precision in one or more areas

    - **Moderate (40–59%)**  
    - Only one or two aspects are addressed explicitly  
    - The child’s response is partial, limited to their own view or surface-level details

    - **Low (20–39%)**  
    - Some vague reference to the situation, but little alignment with the key aspects  
    - The response lacks clear structure or understanding of roles or consequences

    - **Very Low (0–19%)**  
    - The response is unrelated, misinterprets the situation, or shows no clear understanding of the problem
